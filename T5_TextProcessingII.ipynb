    "abstracts = [\"Type 1 diabetes is a chronic, incurable autoimmune disease affecting millions of Americans in which the body stops producing insulin and blood glucose levels rise. The goal of intensive diabetes management is to lower average blood glucose through frequent adjustments to insulin protocol, diet, and behavior. Manual logs and medical device data are collected by patients, but these multiple sources are presented in disparate visualization designs to the clinician-making temporal inference difficult. We conducted a design study over 18 months with clinicians performing intensive diabetes management. We present a data abstraction and novel hierarchical task abstraction for this domain. We also contribute IDMVis: a visualization tool for temporal event sequences with multidimensional, interrelated data. IDMVis includes a novel technique for folding and aligning records by dual sentinel events and scaling the intermediate timeline. We validate our design decisions based on our domain abstractions, best practices, and through a qualitative evaluation with six clinicians. The results of this study indicate that IDMVis accurately reflects the workflow of clinicians. Using IDMVis, clinicians are able to identify issues of data quality such as missing or conflicting data, reconstruct patient records when data is missing, differentiate between days with different patterns, and promote educational interventions after identifying discrepancies.\",\n",
    "\"A common challenge faced by many domain experts working with time series data is how to identify and compare similar patterns. This operation is fundamental in high-level tasks, such as detecting recurring phenomena or creating clusters of similar temporal sequences. While automatic measures exist to compute time series similarity, human intervention is often required to visually inspect these automatically generated results. The visualization literature has examined similarity perception and its relation to automatic similarity measures for line charts, but has not yet considered if alternative visual representations, such as horizon graphs and colorfields, alter this perception. Motivated by how neuroscientists evaluate epileptiform patterns, we conducted two experiments that study how these three visualization techniques affect similarity perception in EEG signals. We seek to understand if the time series results returned from automatic similarity measures are perceived in a similar manner, irrespective of the visualization technique; and if what people perceive as similar with each visualization aligns with different automatic measures and their similarity constraints. Our findings indicate that horizon graphs align with similarity measures that allow local variations in temporal position or speed (i.e., dynamic time warping) more than the two other techniques. On the other hand, horizon graphs do not align with measures that are insensitive to amplitude and y-offset scaling (i.e., measures based on z-normalization), but the inverse seems to be the case for line charts and colorfields. Overall, our work indicates that the choice of visualization affects what temporal patterns we consider as similar, i.e., the notion of similarity in time series is not visualization independent.\",\n",
    "\"The diverse and vibrant ecosystem of interactive visualizations on the web presents an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to observe and analyze how everyday people interact with data visualizations. However, existing metrics of visualization interaction behavior used in research do not fully reveal the breadth of peoples' open-ended explorations with visualizations. One possible way to address this challenge is to determine high-level goals for visualization interaction metrics, and infer corresponding features from user interaction data that characterize different aspects of peoples' explorations of visualizations. In this paper, we identify needs for visualization behavior measurement, and develop corresponding candidate features that can be inferred from users' interaction data. We then propose metrics that capture novel aspects of peoples' open-ended explorations, including exploration uniqueness and exploration pacing. We evaluate these metrics along with four other metrics recently proposed in visualization literature by applying them to interaction data from prior visualization studies. The results of these evaluations suggest that these new metrics 1) reveal new characteristics of peoples' use of visualizations, 2) can be used to evaluate statistical differences between visualization designs, and 3) are statistically independent of prior metrics used in visualization research. We discuss implications of these results for future studies, including the potential for applying these metrics in visualization interaction analysis, as well as emerging challenges in developing and selecting metrics depicting visualization explorations.\",\n",
    "\"Dimensionality reduction is commonly applied to multidimensional data to reduce the complexity of their analysis. In visual analysis systems, projections embed multidimensional data into 2D or 3D spaces for graphical representation. To facilitate a robust and accurate analysis, essential characteristics of the multidimensional data shall be preserved when projecting. Orthographic star coordinates is a state-of-the-art linear projection method that avoids distortion of multidimensional clusters by restricting interactive exploration to orthographic projections. However, existing numerical methods for computing orthographic star coordinates have a number of limitations when putting them into practice. We overcome these limitations by proposing the novel concept of shape-preserving star coordinates where shape preservation is assured using a superset of orthographic projections. Our scheme is explicit, exact, simple, fast, parameter-free, and stable. To maintain a valid shape-preserving star-coordinates configuration during user interaction with one of the star-coordinates axes, we derive an algorithm that only requires us to modify the configuration of one additional compensatory axis. Different design goals can be targeted by using different strategies for selecting the compensatory axis. We propose and discuss four strategies including a strategy that approximates orthographic star coordinates very well and a data-driven strategy. We further present shape-preserving morphing strategies between two shape-preserving configurations, which can be adapted for the generation of data tours. We apply our concept to multiple data analysis scenarios to document its applicability and validate its desired properties.\",\n",
    "\"Today's data-rich documents are often complex datasets in themselves, consisting of information in different formats such as text, figures, and data tables. These additional media augment the textual narrative in the document. However, the static layout of a traditional for-print document often impedes deep understanding of its content because of the need to navigate to access content scattered throughout the text. In this paper, we seek to facilitate enhanced comprehension of such documents through a contextual visualization technique that couples text content with data tables contained in the document. We parse the text content and data tables, cross-link the components using a keyword-based matching algorithm, and generate on-demand visualizations based on the reader's current focus within a document. We evaluate this technique in a user study comparing our approach to a traditional reading experience. Results from our study show that (1) participants comprehend the content better with tighter coupling of text and data, (2) the contextual visualizations enable participants to develop better summaries that capture the main data-rich insights within the document, and (3) overall, our method enables participants to develop a more detailed understanding of the document content.\",\n",
    "\"Interactive ranking techniques have substantially promoted analysts' ability in making judicious and informed decisions effectively based on multiple criteria. However, the existing techniques cannot satisfactorily support the analysis tasks involved in ranking large-scale spatial alternatives, such as selecting optimal locations for chain stores, where the complex spatial contexts involved are essential to the decision-making process. Limitations observed in the prior attempts of integrating rankings with spatial contexts motivate us to develop a context-integrated visual ranking technique. Based on a set of generic design requirements we summarized by collaborating with domain experts, we propose SRVis, a novel spatial ranking visualization technique that supports efficient spatial multi-criteria decision-making processes by addressing three major challenges in the aforementioned context integration, namely, a) the presentation of spatial rankings and contexts, b) the scalability of rankings' visual representations, and c) the analysis of context-integrated spatial rankings. Specifically, we encode massive rankings and their cause with scalable matrix-based visualizations and stacked bar charts based on a novel two-phase optimization framework that minimizes the information loss, and the flexible spatial filtering and intuitive comparative analysis are adopted to enable the in-depth evaluation of the rankings and assist users in selecting the best spatial alternative. The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been evaluated and demonstrated with an empirical study of optimization methods, two case studies, and expert interviews.\",\n",
    "\"Convolutional neural networks can successfully perform many computer vision tasks on images. For visualization, how do CNNs perform when applied to graphical perception tasks? We investigate this question by reproducing Cleveland and McGill's seminal 1984 experiments, which measured human perception efficiency of different visual encodings and defined elementary perceptual tasks for visualization. We measure the graphical perceptual capabilities of four network architectures on five different visualization tasks and compare to existing and new human performance baselines. While under limited circumstances CNNs are able to meet or outperform human task performance, we find that CNNs are not currently a good model for human graphical perception. We present the results of these experiments to foster the understanding of how CNNs succeed and fail when applied to data visualizations.\",\n",
    "\"When analyzing a visualized network, users need to explore different sections of the network to gain insight. However, effective exploration of large networks is often a challenge. While various tools are available for users to explore the global and local features of a network, these tools usually require significant interaction activities, such as repetitive navigation actions to follow network nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose a structure-based suggestive exploration approach to support effective exploration of large networks by suggesting appropriate structures upon user request. Encoding nodes with vectorized representations by transforming information of surrounding structures of nodes into a high dimensional space, our approach can identify similar structures within a large network, enable user interaction with multiple similar structures simultaneously, and guide the exploration of unexplored structures. We develop a web-based visual exploration system to incorporate this suggestive exploration approach and compare performances of our approach under different vectorizing methods and networks. We also present the usability and effectiveness of our approach through a controlled user study with two datasets.\",\n",
    "\"Multiclass maps are scatterplots, multidimensional projections, or thematic geographic maps where data points have a categorical attribute in addition to two quantitative attributes. This categorical attribute is often rendered using shape or color, which does not scale when overplotting occurs. When the number of data points increases, multiclass maps must resort to data aggregation to remain readable. We present multiclass density maps: multiple 2D histograms computed for each of the category values. Multiclass density maps are meant as a building block to improve the expressiveness and scalability of multiclass map visualization. In this article, we first present a short survey of aggregated multiclass maps, mainly from cartography. We then introduce a declarative model-a simple yet expressive JSON grammar associated with visual semantics-that specifies a wide design space of visualizations for multiclass density maps. Our declarative model is expressive and can be efficiently implemented in visualization front-ends such as modern web browsers. Furthermore, it can be reconfigured dynamically to support data exploration tasks without recomputing the raw data. Finally, we demonstrate how our model can be used to reproduce examples from the past and support exploring data at scale.\",\n",
    "\"We present the results of two perception studies to assess how quickly people can perform a simple data comparison task for small-scale visualizations on a smartwatch. The main goal of these studies is to extend our understanding of design constraints for smartwatch visualizations. Previous work has shown that a vast majority of smartwatch interactions last under 5 s. It is still unknown what people can actually perceive from visualizations during such short glances, in particular with such a limited display space of smartwatches. To shed light on this question, we conducted two perception studies that assessed the lower bounds of task time for a simple data comparison task. We tested three chart types common on smartwatches: bar charts, donut charts, and radial bar charts with three different data sizes: 7, 12, and 24 data values. In our first study, we controlled the differences of the two target bars to be compared, while the second study varied the difference randomly. For both studies, we found that participants performed the task on average in &lt;;300 ms for the bar chart, &lt;;220 ms for the donut chart, and in &lt;; 1780 ms for the radial bar chart. Thresholds in the second study per chart type were on average 1.14-1.35× higher than in the first study. Our results show that bar and donut charts should be preferred on smartwatch displays when quick data comparisons are necessary.\",\n",
    "\"Visualization tools are often specialized for specific tasks, which turns the user's analytical workflow into a fragmented process performed across many tools. In this paper, we present a component model design for data visualization to promote modular designs of visualization tools that enhance their analytical scope. Rather than fragmenting tasks across tools, the component model supports unification, where components-the building blocks of this model-can be assembled to support a wide range of tasks. Furthermore, the model also provides additional key properties, such as support for collaboration, sharing across multiple devices, and adaptive usage depending on expertise, from creating visualizations using dropdown menus, through instantiating components, to actually modifying components or creating entirely new ones from scratch using JavaScript or Python source code. To realize our model, we introduce Vistrates, a literate computing platform for developing, assembling, and sharing visualization components. From a visualization perspective, Vistrates features cross-cutting components for visual representations, interaction, collaboration, and device responsiveness maintained in a component repository. From a development perspective, Vistrates offers a collaborative programming environment where novices and experts alike can compose component pipelines for specific analytical activities. Finally, we present several Vistrates use cases that span the full range of the classic “anytime” and “anywhere” motto for ubiquitous analysis: from mobile and on-the-go usage, through office settings, to collaborative smart environments covering a variety of tasks and devices..\",\n",
    "\"Recently, an increasing number of visualization systems have begun to incorporate natural language generation (NLG) capabilities into their interfaces. NLG-based visualization systems typically leverage a suite of statistical functions to automatically extract key facts about the underlying data and surface them as natural language sentences alongside visualizations. With current systems, users are typically required to read the system-generated sentences and mentally map them back to the accompanying visualization. However, depending on the features of the visualization (e.g., visualization type, data density) and the complexity of the data fact, mentally mapping facts to visualizations can be a challenging task. Furthermore, more than one visualization could be used to illustrate a single data fact. Unfortunately, current tools provide little or no support for users to explore such alternatives. In this paper, we explore how system-generated data facts can be treated as interactive widgets to help users interpret visualizations and communicate their findings. We present Voder, a system that lets users interact with automatically-generated data facts to explore both alternative visualizations to convey a data fact as well as a set of embellishments to highlight a fact within a visualization. Leveraging data facts as interactive widgets, Voder also facilitates data fact-based visualization search. To assess Voder's design and features, we conducted a preliminary user study with 12 participants having varying levels of experience with visualization tools. Participant feedback suggested that interactive data facts aided them in interpreting visualizations. Participants also stated that the suggestions surfaced through the facts helped them explore alternative visualizations and embellishments to communicate individual data facts.\",\n",
    "\"Recently, an approach for determining the value of a visualization was proposed, one moving beyond simple measurements of task accuracy and speed. The value equation contains components for the time savings a visualization provides, the insights and insightful questions it spurs, the overall essence of the data it conveys, and the confidence about the data and its domain it inspires. This articulation of value is purely descriptive, however, providing no actionable method of assessing a visualization's value. In this work, we create a heuristic-based evaluation methodology to accompany the value equation for assessing interactive visualizations. We refer to the methodology colloquially as ICE-T, based on an anagram of the four value components. Our approach breaks the four components down into guidelines, each of which is made up of a small set of low-level heuristics. Evaluators who have knowledge of visualization design principles then assess the visualization with respect to the heuristics. We conducted an initial trial of the methodology on three interactive visualizations of the same data set, each evaluated by 15 visualization experts. We found that the methodology showed promise, obtaining consistent ratings across the three visualizations and mirroring judgments of the utility of the visualizations by instructors of the course in which they were developed.\",\n",
    "\"To interpret data visualizations, people must determine how visual features map onto concepts. For example, to interpret colormaps, people must determine how dimensions of color (e.g., lightness, hue) map onto quantities of a given measure (e.g., brain activity, correlation magnitude). This process is easier when the encoded mappings in the visualization match people's predictions of how visual features will map onto concepts, their inferred mappings. To harness this principle in visualization design, it is necessary to understand what factors determine people's inferred mappings. In this study, we investigated how inferred color-quantity mappings for colormap data visualizations were influenced by the background color. Prior literature presents seemingly conflicting accounts of how the background color affects inferred color-quantity mappings. The present results help resolve those conflicts, demonstrating that sometimes the background has an effect and sometimes it does not, depending on whether the colormap appears to vary in opacity. When there is no apparent variation in opacity, participants infer that darker colors map to larger quantities (dark-is-more bias). As apparent variation in opacity increases, participants become biased toward inferring that more opaque colors map to larger quantities (opaque-is-more bias). These biases work together on light backgrounds and conflict on dark backgrounds. Under such conflicts, the opaque-is-more bias can negate, or even supersede the dark-is-more bias. The results suggest that if a design goal is to produce colormaps that match people's inferred mappings and are robust to changes in background color, it is beneficial to use colormaps that will not appear to vary in opacity on any background color, and to encode larger quantities in darker colors.\",\n",
    "\"Analyzing large, multivariate graphs is an important problem in many domains, yet such graphs are challenging to visualize. In this paper, we introduce a novel, scalable, tree-table multivariate graph visualization technique, which makes many tasks related to multivariate graph analysis easier to achieve. The core principle we follow is to selectively query for nodes or subgraphs of interest and visualize these subgraphs as a spanning tree of the graph. The tree is laid out linearly, which enables us to juxtapose the nodes with a table visualization where diverse attributes can be shown. We also use this table as an adjacency matrix, so that the resulting technique is a hybrid node-link/adjacency matrix technique. We implement this concept in Juniper and complement it with a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to dynamically grow, restructure, and aggregate the tree, as well as change the layout or show paths between nodes. We demonstrate the utility of our tool in usage scenarios for different multivariate networks: a bipartite network of scholars, papers, and citation metrics and a multitype network of story characters, places, books, etc.\",\n",
    "\"Many real-world datasets are large, multivariate, and relational in nature and relevant associated decisions frequently require a simultaneous consideration of both attributes and connections. Existing visualization systems and approaches, however, often make an explicit trade-off between either affording rich exploration of individual data units and their attributes or exploration of the underlying network structure. In doing so, important analysis opportunities and insights are potentially missed. In this study, we aim to address this gap by (1) considering visualizations and interaction techniques that blend the spectrum between unit and network visualizations, (2) discussing the nature of different forms of contexts and the challenges in implementing them, and (3) demonstrating the value of our approach for visual exploration of multivariate, relational data for a real-world use case. Specifically, we demonstrate through a system called Graphicle how network structure can be layered on top of unit visualization techniques to create new opportunities for visual exploration of physician characteristics and referral data. We report on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the system and effectiveness of our blended approach.\",\n",
    "\"This paper presents DXR, a toolkit for building immersive data visualizations based on the Unity development platform. Over the past years, immersive data visualizations in augmented and virtual reality (AR, VR) have been emerging as a promising medium for data sense-making beyond the desktop. However, creating immersive visualizations remains challenging, and often require complex low-level programming and tedious manual encoding of data attributes to geometric and visual properties. These can hinder the iterative idea-to-prototype process, especially for developers without experience in 3D graphics, AR, and VR programming. With DXR, developers can efficiently specify visualization designs using a concise declarative visualization grammar inspired by Vega-Lite. DXR further provides a GUI for easy and quick edits and previews of visualization designs in-situ, i.e., while immersed in the virtual world. DXR also provides reusable templates and customizable graphical marks, enabling unique and engaging visualizations. We demonstrate the flexibility of DXR through several examples spanning a wide range of applications.\",\n",
    "\"We present Charticulator, an interactive authoring tool that enables the creation of bespoke and reusable chart layouts. Charticulator is our response to most existing chart construction interfaces that require authors to choose from predefined chart layouts, thereby precluding the construction of novel charts. In contrast, Charticulator transforms a chart specification into mathematical layout constraints and automatically computes a set of layout attributes using a constraint-solving algorithm to realize the chart. It allows for the articulation of compound marks or glyphs as well as links between these glyphs, all without requiring any coding or knowledge of constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, thanks to the constraint-based layout approach, Charticulator can export chart designs into reusable templates that can be imported into other visualization tools. In addition to describing Charticulator's conceptual framework and design, we present three forms of evaluation: a gallery to illustrate its expressiveness, a user study to verify its usability, and a click-count comparison between Charticulator and three existing tools. Finally, we discuss the limitations and potentials of Charticulator as well as directions for future research. Charticulator is available with its source code at https://charticulator.com.\",\n",

We first propose a design space characterizing composite physicalizations based on previous work in the fields of Information Visualization and Human Computer Interaction. We illustrate dynamic composite physicalizations in two scenarios demonstrating potential benefits for collaboration and decision making, as well as new opportunities for physical interaction. We then describe our implementation using wheeled micro-robots capable of locating themselves and sensing user input, before discussing limitations and opportunities for future work.\",\n",
    "\"Visualizing 3D trajectories to extract insights about their similarities and spatial configuration is a critical task in several domains. Air traffic controllers for example deal with large quantities of aircrafts routes to optimize safety in airspace and neuroscientists attempt to understand neuronal pathways in the human brain by visualizing bundles of fibers from DTI images. Extracting insights from masses of 3D trajectories is challenging as the multiple three dimensional lines have complex geometries, may overlap, cross or even merge with each other, making it impossible to follow individual ones in dense areas. As trajectories are inherently spatial and three dimensional, we propose FiberClay: a system to display and interact with 3D trajectories in immersive environments. FiberClay renders a large quantity of trajectories in real time using GP-GPU techniques. FiberClay also introduces a new set of interactive techniques for composing complex queries in 3D space leveraging immersive environment controllers and user position. These techniques enable an analyst to select and compare sets of trajectories with specific geometries and data properties. We conclude by discussing insights found using FiberClay with domain experts in air traffic control and neurology.\",\n",
    "\"Immersive virtual- and augmented-reality headsets can overlay a flat image against any surface or hang virtual objects in the space around the user. The technology is rapidly improving and may, in the long term, replace traditional flat panel displays in many situations. When displays are no longer intrinsically flat, how should we use the space around the user for abstract data visualisation? In this paper, we ask this question with respect to origin-destination flow data in a global geographic context. We report on the findings of three studies exploring different spatial encodings for flow maps. The first experiment focuses on different 2D and 3D encodings for flows on flat maps. We find that participants are significantly more accurate with raised flow paths whose height is proportional to flow distance but fastest with traditional straight line 2D flows. In our second and third experiment we compared flat maps, 3D globes and a novel interactive design we call<i>MapsLink</i>, involving a pair of linked flat maps. We find that participants took significantly more time with MapsLink than other flow maps while the 3D globe with raised flows was the fastest, most accurate, and most preferred method. Our work suggests that<i>careful</i>use of the third spatial dimension can resolve visual clutter in complex flow maps.\",\n",
    "\"A common approach to sampling the space of a prediction is the generation of an ensemble of potential outcomes, where the ensemble's distribution reveals the statistical structure of the prediction space. For example, the US National Hurricane Center generates multiple day predictions for a storm's path, size, and wind speed, and then uses a Monte Carlo approach to sample this prediction into a large ensemble of potential storm outcomes. Various forms of summary visualizations are generated from such an ensemble, often using spatial spread to indicate its statistical characteristics. However, studies have shown that changes in the size of such summary glyphs, representing changes in the uncertainty of the prediction, are frequently confounded with other attributes of the phenomenon, such as its size or strength. In addition, simulation ensembles typically encode multivariate information, which can be difficult or confusing to include in a summary display. This problem can be overcome by directly displaying the ensemble as a set of annotated trajectories, however this solution will not be effective if ensembles are densely overdrawn or structurally disorganized. We propose to overcome these difficulties by selectively sampling the original ensemble, constructing a smaller representative and spatially well organized ensemble. This can be drawn directly as a set of paths that implicitly reveals the underlying spatial uncertainty distribution of the prediction. Since this approach does not use a visual channel to encode uncertainty, additional information can more easily be encoded in the display without leading to visual confusion. To demonstrate our argument, we describe the development of a visualization for ensembles of tropical cyclone forecast tracks, explaining how their spatial and temporal predictions, as well as other crucial storm characteristics such as size and intensity, can be clearly revealed. We verify the effectiveness of this visualization approach through a cognitive study exploring how storm damage estimates are affected by the density of tracks drawn, and by the presence or absence of annotating information on storm size and intensity.\",\n",
    "\"Non-linear dimensionality reduction (NDR) methods such as LLE and t-SNE are popular with visualization researchers and experienced data analysts, but present serious problems of interpretation. In this paper, we present DimReader, a technique that recovers readable axes from such techniques. DimReader is based on analyzing infinitesimal perturbations of the dataset with respect to variables of interest. The perturbations define exactly how we want to change each point in the original dataset and we measure the effect that these changes have on the projection. The recovered axes are in direct analogy with the axis lines (grid lines) of traditional scatterplots. We also present methods for discovering perturbations on the input data that change the projection the most. The calculation of the perturbations is efficient and easily integrated into programs written in modern programming languages. We present results of DimReader on a variety of NDR methods and datasets both synthetic and real-life, and show how it can be used to compare different NDR methods. Finally, we discuss limitations of our proposal and situations where further research is needed.\",\n",

Here, we introduce a visualization system that, through a tight yet flexible integration between visualization elements and the underlying model, allows a user to interrogate the model by perturbing the input, internal state, and prediction while observing changes in other parts of the pipeline. We use the natural language inference problem as an example to illustrate how a perturbation-driven paradigm can help domain experts assess the potential limitation of a model, probe its inner states, and interpret and form hypotheses about fundamental model mechanisms such as attention.\",\n",
    "\"Details-on-demand is a crucial feature in the visual information-seeking process but is often only implemented in highly constrained settings. The most common solution, hover queries (i.e., tooltips), are fast and expressive but are usually limited to single mark (e.g., a bar in a bar chart). `Queries' to retrieve details for more complex sets of objects (e.g., comparisons between pairs of elements, averages across multiple items, trend lines, etc.) are difficult for end-users to invoke explicitly. Further, the output of these queries require complex annotations and overlays which need to be displayed and dismissed on demand to avoid clutter. In this work we introduce SmartCues, a library to support details-on-demand through dynamically computed overlays. For end-users, SmartCues provides multitouch interactions to construct complex queries for a variety of details. For designers, SmartCues offers an interaction library that can be used out-of-the-box, and can be extended for new charts and detail types. We demonstrate how SmartCues can be implemented across a wide array of visualization types and, through a lab study, show that end users can effectively use SmartCues.\",\n",
    "\"Visual designs can be complex in modern data visualization systems, which poses special challenges for explaining them to the non-experts. However, few if any presentation tools are tailored for this purpose. In this study, we present Narvis, a slideshow authoring tool designed for introducing data visualizations to non-experts. Narvis targets two types of end users: teachers, experts in data visualization who produce tutorials for explaining a data visualization, and students, non-experts who try to understand visualization designs through tutorials. We present an analysis of requirements through close discussions with the two types of end users. The resulting considerations guide the design and implementation of Narvis. Additionally, to help teachers better organize their introduction slideshows, we specify a data visualization as a hierarchical combination of components, which are automatically detected and extracted by Narvis. The teachers craft an introduction slideshow through first organizing these components, and then explaining them sequentially. A series of templates are provided for adding annotations and animations to improve efficiency during the authoring process. We evaluate Narvis through a qualitative analysis of the authoring experience, and a preliminary evaluation of the generated slideshows.\",\n",
    "\"Human decisions are prone to biases, and this is no less true for decisions made within data visualizations. Bias mitigation strategies often focus on the person, by educating people about their biases, typically with little success. We focus instead on the system, presenting the first evidence that altering the design of an interactive visualization tool can mitigate a strong bias - the attraction effect. Participants viewed 2D scatterplots where choices between superior alternatives were affected by the placement of other suboptimal points. We found that highlighting the superior alternatives weakened the bias, but did not eliminate it. We then tested an interactive approach where participants completely removed locally dominated points from the view, inspired by the elimination by aspects strategy in the decision-making literature. This approach strongly decreased the bias, leading to a counterintuitive suggestion: tools that allow removing inappropriately salient or distracting data from a view may help lead users to make more rational decisions.\",\n",
    "\"In the first crowdsourced visualization experiment conducted exclusively on mobile phones, we compare approaches to visualizing ranges over time on small displays. People routinely consume such data via a mobile phone, from temperatures in weather forecasting apps to sleep and blood pressure readings in personal health apps. However, we lack guidance on how to effectively visualize ranges on small displays in the context of different value retrieval and comparison tasks, or with respect to different data characteristics such as periodicity, seasonality, or the cardinality of ranges. Central to our experiment is a comparison between two ways to lay out ranges: a more conventional linear layout strikes a balance between quantitative and chronological scale resolution, while a less conventional radial layout emphasizes the cyclicality of time and may prioritize discrimination between values at its periphery. With results from 87 crowd workers, we found that while participants completed tasks more quickly with linear layouts than with radial ones, there were few differences in terms of error rate between layout conditions. We also found that participants performed similarly with both layouts in tasks that involved comparing superimposed observed and average ranges.\",\n",
    "\"Interactive wall-sized displays benefit data visualization. Due to their sheer display size, they make it possible to show large amounts of data in multiple coordinated views (MCV) and facilitate collaborative data analysis. In this work, we propose a set of important design considerations and contribute a fundamental input vocabulary and interaction mapping for MCV functionality. We also developed a fully functional application with more than 45 coordinated views visualizing a real-world, multivariate data set of crime activities, which we used in a comprehensive qualitative user study investigating how pairs of users behave. Most importantly, we found that flexible movement is essential and-depending on user goals-is connected to collaboration, perception, and interaction. Therefore, we argue that for future systems interaction from the distance is required and needs good support. We show that our consistent design for both direct touch at the large display and distant interaction using mobile phones enables the seamless exploration of large-scale MCV at wall-sized displays. Our MCV application builds on design aspects such as simplicity, flexibility, and visual consistency and, therefore, supports realistic workflows. We believe that in the future, many visual data analysis scenarios will benefit from wall-sized displays presenting numerous coordinated visualizations, for which our findings provide a valuable foundation.\",\n",

To exemplify this idea, we present viScent: A six-scent stereo olfactory display capable of conveying olfactory glyphs of varying temperature and direction, as well as a corresponding software system that integrates the display with a traditional visualization display. Finally, we present three applications that make use of the viScent system: A 2D graph visualization, a 2D line and point chart, and an immersive analytics graph visualization in 3D virtual reality.

While empirical studies can provide design guidance, we lack a formal framework for representing design knowledge, integrating results across studies, and applying this knowledge in automated design tools that promote effective encodings and facilitate visual exploration. We propose modeling visualization design knowledge as a collection of constraints, in conjunction with a method to learn weights for soft constraints from experimental data. Using constraints, we can take theoretical design knowledge and express it in a concrete, extensible, and testable form: the resulting models can recommend visualization designs and can easily be augmented with additional constraints or updated weights. We implement our approach in Draco, a constraint-based system based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). We demonstrate how to construct increasingly sophisticated automated visualization design systems, including systems based on weights learned directly from the results of graphical perception experiments.\",\n",
    "\"Applied visualization researchers often work closely with domain collaborators to explore new and useful applications of visualization. The early stages of collaborations are typically time consuming for all stakeholders as researchers piece together an understanding of domain challenges from disparate discussions and meetings. A number of recent projects, however, report on the use of creative visualization-opportunities (CVO) workshops to accelerate the early stages of applied work, eliciting a wealth of requirements in a few days of focused work. Yet, there is no established guidance for how to use such workshops effectively. In this paper, we present the results of a 2-year collaboration in which we analyzed the use of 17 workshops in 10 visualization contexts. Its primary contribution is a framework for CVO workshops that: 1) identifies a process model for using workshops; 2) describes a structure of what happens within effective workshops; 3) recommends 25 actionable guidelines for future workshops; and 4) presents an example workshop and workshop methods. The creation of this framework exemplifies the use of critical reflection to learn about visualization in practice from diverse studies and experience.\",\n",
    "\"When inspecting information visualizations under time critical settings, such as emergency response or monitoring the heart rate in a surgery room, the user only has a small amount of time to view the visualization “at a glance”. In these settings, it is important to provide a quantitative measure of the visualization to understand whether or not the visualization is too “complex” to accurately judge at a glance. This paper proposes Pixel Approximate Entropy (PAE), which adapts the approximate entropy statistical measure commonly used to quantify regularity and unpredictability in time-series data, as a measure of visual complexity for line charts. We show that PAE is correlated with user-perceived chart complexity, and that increased chart PAE correlates with reduced judgement accuracy. `We also find that the correlation between PAE values and participants' judgment increases when the user has less time to examine the line charts.\",\n",
    "\"We consider temporally evolving trees with changing topology and data: tree nodes may persist for a time range, merge or split, and the associated data may change. Essentially, one can think of this as a time series of trees with a node correspondence per hierarchy level between consecutive time steps. Existing visualization approaches for such data include animated 2D treemaps, where the dynamically changing layout makes it difficult to observe the data in its entirety. We present a method to visualize this dynamic data in a static, nested, and space-filling visualization. This is based on two major contributions: First, the layout constitutes a graph drawing problem. We approach it for the entire time span at once using a combination of a heuristic and simulated annealing. Second, we propose a rendering that emphasizes the hierarchy through an adaption of the classic cushion treemaps. We showcase the wide range of applicability using data from feature tracking in time-dependent scalar fields, evolution of file system hierarchies, and world population.\",\n",
    "\"Selecting a good aspect ratio is crucial for effective 2D diagrams. There are several aspect ratio selection methods for function plots and line charts, but only few can handle general, discrete diagrams such as 2D scatter plots. However, these methods either lack a perceptual foundation or heavily rely on intermediate isoline representations, which depend on choosing the right isovalues and are time-consuming to compute. This paper introduces a general image-based approach for selecting aspect ratios for a wide variety of 2D diagrams, ranging from scatter plots and density function plots to line charts. Our approach is derived from Federer's co-area formula and a line integral representation that enable us to directly construct image-based versions of existing selection methods using density fields. In contrast to previous methods, our approach bypasses isoline computation, so it is faster to compute, while following the perceptual foundation to select aspect ratios. Furthermore, this approach is complemented by an anisotropic kernel density estimation to construct density fields, allowing us to more faithfully characterize data patterns, such as the subgroups in scatterplots or dense regions in time series. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by quantitatively comparing to previous methods and revisiting a prior user study. Finally, we present extensions for ROI banking, multi-scale banking, and the application to image data.\"]"
